When developing different parts of an application at work we use Git and Git Flow to merge all changes into a parent branch. Once a feature of an app is finished we create a pull request that contains changes to be added to a predecessor branch (usually develop).

The flow simply goes like this:

1. Create a branch from e.g. develop
2. Apply your changes to the source code
3. Create a pull request to be merged into e.g. develop
4. Discuss changes with your peers, explain your point of view & apply suggested improvements (code review)
5. Your peers approves your changes
6. Merge your code into source branch
